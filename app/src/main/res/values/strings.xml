    <string name="AboutUsBriefHistoryFirstStatement">
        In 1968, at the corner of R. Papa and Lepanto streets, between the two giants in Philippine private education (University of the East with its mammoth population of 65,000 and Far Eastern University with 47,000 enrollees), a small building was erected to house a small school ‚Äì National College of Business and Arts (N.C.B.A).
    </string>
    <string name="AboutUsBriefHistorySecondStatement">
        NCBA‚Äôs founder was the late Dr. Doroteo S. Pasion, a well-known educator (former Dean of Commerce of San Beda College, former CPA Review Director of the University of the East, and former President of PSBA), lawyer, accountant, author and civic leader. Dr. Pasion launched NCBA as a public service together with four others who believed in the NCBA concept: Col. Rafael Q. Yap-Diangco, Atty. Jose R. Torres, Mrs. Gloria C. Me√±ez and Mrs. Lourdes L. Sarabia.
    </string>
