    <!-- 1.2. ====================== ABOUT US PROGRAMS | BRIEF HISTORY ====================== -->
    <string name="AboutUsBriefHistoryFirstStatement">
        In 1968, at the corner of R. Papa and Lepanto streets, between the two giants in Philippine private education (University of the East with its mammoth population of 65,000 and Far Eastern University with 47,000 enrollees), a small building was erected to house a small school – National College of Business and Arts (N.C.B.A).
    </string>
    <string name="AboutUsBriefHistorySecondStatement">
        NCBA’s founder was the late Dr. Doroteo S. Pasion, a well-known educator (former Dean of Commerce of San Beda College, former CPA Review Director of the University of the East, and former President of PSBA), lawyer, accountant, author and civic leader. Dr. Pasion launched NCBA as a public service together with four others who believed in the NCBA concept: Col. Rafael Q. Yap-Diangco, Atty. Jose R. Torres, Mrs. Gloria C. Meñez and Mrs. Lourdes L. Sarabia.
    </string>
    <string name="AboutUsBriefHistoryThirdStatement">
        Keeping to its founder’s vision, NCBA opted to remain as a specialized school and its growth sustained and steady through the years. From a small edifice along R. Papa Street, NCBA slowly expanded its academic programs and facilities with the single purpose of producing for the Nation the type of educated manpower it needs for national development.
    </string>
    <string name="AboutUsBriefHistoryFourthStatement">
        When NCBA opened in 1968, its initial offerings were limited to the following courses: Bachelor of Science in Business Administration; Bachelor of Arts; a two-year course in Secretarial Administration; and its own CPA Review. The High School department was opened in School Year 1973-1974, followed by its additional offerings of short terminal courses in Cooperative; Salesmanship; Bookkeeping and Accounting; and Small Business Management in School Year 1974-1975.
    </string>
    <string name="AboutUsBriefHistoryFifthStatement">
        Today, NCBA has a total of three campuses (Cubao, Taytay and Fairview) and boasts of a complete package of academic offerings from K-12 school to an expanded tertiary education program and graduate courses.
    </string>
    <string name="AboutUsBriefHistorySixthStatement">
        The three campuses of NCBA are PACUCOA accredited for its BSBA program to attest that the College has formal recognition of an educational program possessing high level of quality based on the analysis of the merits of its educational operations in attaining its objectives and its role in the community that it serves.
    </string>
    <string name="AboutUsBriefHistorySeventhStatement">
        Since its founding, NCBA has endeavored continually to perpetuate its educational policy to offer and provide both facilities and teaching force, a complete education for young men and women and equip them with the skills and training to become responsible citizens and future leaders of the country.
